<p>Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums.<br>If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.</p>

<p>Example 1:<br>Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]</p>

<p>Output: 1<br>Explanation:<br>The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.<br>The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.<br>The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.<br>The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.<br>The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.<br>Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.</p>

<p>Example 2:<br>Input: nums = [2,-1,1]<br>Output: 1<br>Explanation: 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.</p>

<p>Constraints:<br>1 <= n <= 1000<br>-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5</p>
