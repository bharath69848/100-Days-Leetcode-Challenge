<h1>Is Subsequence</h1>
<p>Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.</p>
<p>A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).</p>


<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"<br>
Output: true</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"<br>
Output: false</p>

<h3>Constraints:</h3>
<p>0 <= s.length <= 100<br>
0 <= t.length <= 104<br>
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.</p>
